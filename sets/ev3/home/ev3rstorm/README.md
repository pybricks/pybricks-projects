# Example LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Ev3rstorm Program

This program requires LEGO® EV3 MicroPython v2.0 downloadable at https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3.

Building instructions can be found at https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/mindstorms/buildarobot.

Ev3rstorm works as follows:

- You can drive Ev3rstorm around with the IR beacon.

- Ev3rstorm dances by turning by random angles on the spot when the Beacon button is pressed.

- Ev3rstorm blasts his bazooka when his Touch Sensor is pressed. If you cover the Color Sensor then he will shoot upwards, or he will shoot downwards.
