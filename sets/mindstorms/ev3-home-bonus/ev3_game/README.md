# Example LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3Game Program

This program requires LEGO® EV3 MicroPython v2.0 downloadable https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3.

Building instructions can be found at https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/mindstorms/buildarobot.

EV3Game works as follows:

- Put a small ball or marble under the middle cup. 

- Choose the difficulty level by the IR beacon buttons: the Up buttons raise the level (up to 9) and the Down buttons lower the level (minimum 1). The level is printed on the screen.

- Press the Touch Sensor to start the game and make the robot shuffle the cups.

- Guess which cup has the ball by pressing:
  - Left Up IR button: choose left cup
  - Beacon IR button (press twice): choose middle cup
  - Right Up IR button: choose right cup

- Repeat again and again to play many games.
