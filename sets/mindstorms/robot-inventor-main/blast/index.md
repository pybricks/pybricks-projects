This program requires PyBricks v3 firmware installed on the Inventor Hub.

The playing instructions for each robot variant are in the docstrings of the corresponding file.

The code for Blast's basic dance is in `blast-basic.py` as follows:

{% include copy-code.html %}
```python
{% include_relative blast-basic.py %}
```
