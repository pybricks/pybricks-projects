    "If you have never built a LEGO MINDSTORMS robot before, we recommend you start by building this one! TRACK3R is a crawler-mounted, all-terrain robot with four interchangeable tools. Start by building the body of the robot, then discover the possibilities of the four different TRACK3R tools: the bi-blade blender, the blasting bazooka, the gripping claw, and the hammer."
