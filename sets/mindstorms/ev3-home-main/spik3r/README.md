# Example LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Spik3r Program

This program requires LEGO® EV3 MicroPython v2.0 downloadable at https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3.

Building instructions can be found at https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/mindstorms/buildarobot.

Spik3r works as follows:

- Spik3r stings with its Lightning Tail when the Beacon button is pressed

- Spik3r moves forward when the IR Beacon's two Up buttons are pressed, and turns right when only the Right Up button is pressed

- Spik3r crushes objects with its Claw when the Touch Sensor is pressed
