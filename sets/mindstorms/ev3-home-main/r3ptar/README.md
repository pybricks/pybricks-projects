# Example LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 R3ptar Program

This program requires LEGO® EV3 MicroPython v2.0 downloadable at https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3.

Building instructions can be found at https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/mindstorms/buildarobot.

R3ptar can be driven around by the IR Remote Control, strikes when the Beacon button is pressed, and hisses when the Touch Sensor is pressed.
