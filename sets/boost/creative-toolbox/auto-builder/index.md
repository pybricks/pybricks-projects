# Coding instructions

This program resets the motors to known positions, and then constructs the
LEGO figure brick-by-brick.

This works by repeatedly:
- moving the belt motor to the given brick;
- picking the brick up by moving the arm down and up;
- moving the belt back to the base position;
- putting the brick down.

The brick positions are given as the degrees the belt motor turns relative to
the base position. You can tweak these values by a few degrees if needed.

```python
{% include_relative main.py %}
```


# Further exploration

The provided program is very basic, demonstrating only the core principles.
Here's a few ideas and challenges for further exploration:
- Change the order of the bricks in the `for`-loop to build something else.
- Instead of pushing the element down for two seconds, you could stop sooner.
  Try experimenting with the [run_until_stalled](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/pupdevices/motor.html#pybricks.pupdevices.Motor.run_until_stalled)
  method. This can speed up the build process.
- Speaking of increasing speed, how fast can you make it? Optimize this robot
  and set a new world record!
