# Code

This is an example program to help you get R2-D2 moving. If you are just getting
started with coding, you don't need to understand all of it. Just scroll down
to the `MAIN PROGRAM` section and start there.

{% include copy-code.html %}
```python
{% include_relative main.py %}
```


# Further exploration

Here's a few ideas and challenges for further exploration:

- Modify the main program to call `stare_and_turn(360 * 2)` to see R2-D2 turn
  his body without turning his head.
- Write your own function to combine a sequence of actions. Then use it as
  part of a more complex program.

  ```python
  def my_function():
      # Write your commands here!
  ```

- Create an obstacle course for R2-D2 and write a program to navigate safely
  around the obstructions.
