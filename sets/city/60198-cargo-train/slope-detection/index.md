## Building instructions
Build the train using the standard instructions. Mount the
[tilt sensor][tiltsensor]
horizontally in the train, with the cable side facing towards direction of
driving:

Connect the motor to port A and connect the tilt sensor to port B.

## Coding Instructions



This program makes the train drive until it detects a slope of 8 degrees or
more. Then it drives back down.

```python
{% include_relative main.py %}
```

## Programming and running instructions
The train must start on a horizontal track. Then run the program.
