# Rail slope detection

Made by: The Pybricks Authors

## Introduction

This project shows how you can integrate the
[Tilt Sensor](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/pupdevices.html#tilt-sensor)
in your LEGO trains. You can use this sensor to detect a slope in the rail
track.

## Demo

This program makes the train drive until it detects a slope of 8 degrees or
more. Then it drives back down. You can watch a video
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc0mRIBjhIU).

## Requirements
- Generic LEGO train, such as 60197 or 60198
- Powered Up [Tilt Sensor](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/pupdevices.html#tilt-sensor)

## Building instructions
Build the train using the standard instructions. Mount the Tilt Sensor anywhere
on the train. See the video for an example. Mount it horizontally. The side
with the cable should face towards the front: in the direction of driving.

## Ports
- Train motor on port A 
- Tilt sensor on port B

## Programming and running instructions
The train must start on a horizontal track. Then run the program.
