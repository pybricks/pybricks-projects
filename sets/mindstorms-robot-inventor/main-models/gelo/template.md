## Program

Use this script as a starting point for your own Gelo program.

This script makes use of the [gelo.py](../#gelo-module) module, so make
sure to save that program in Pybricks Code first.

### Tip

In Pybricks Code, type `gelo` and then `.` to see what Gelo can do and get help
on what parameters you can pass to the methods.

{% include copy-code.html %}
```python
{% include_relative gelo_template.py %}
```
