## Instructions

This script makes use of the [gelo.py](../#gelo-module) module, so make
sure to save that program in Pybricks Code first.

Then save the script below as `gelo_tricks.py` and run it.

Wave one of the colors on the bone in front of the color sensor on Gelo and
watch which trick he does.

The tricks work best when Gelo is on carpet where he can get a good grip.
