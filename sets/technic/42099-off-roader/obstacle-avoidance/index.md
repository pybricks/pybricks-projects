# Selecting a sensor
This project will work with any sensor that can measure distance.

You can use
the [Color and Distance sensor](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/pupdevices/colordistancesensor.html)
as in this example, but you can also use the
[Ultrasonic Sensor](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/pupdevices/ultrasonicsensor.html)
or the
[Infrared Sensor](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/pupdevices/infraredsensor.html).
Mount the sensor somewhere on the front of your truck.

# Main program

This program builds on the basic [driving example](../driving). It makes the
truck back up and turn when it detects an obstacle.
