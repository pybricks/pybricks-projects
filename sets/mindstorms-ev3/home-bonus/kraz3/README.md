# Example LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Kraz3 Program

This program requires LEGO® EV3 MicroPython v2.0 downloadable at https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3.

Building instructions can be found at https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/mindstorms/buildarobot.

Drive Kraz3 around according to instructions from Channel 1 of the IR Remote Control:
    - 2 Top/Up Buttons together: drive forward
    - 2 Bottom/Down Buttons together: drive backward
    - Top-Left/Red-Up: turn left forward
    - Top-Right/Blue-Up: turn right forward
    - Bottom-Left/Red-Down: turn left backward
    - Bottom-Right/Blue-Down: turn right backward

Kraz3 makes a kung-fu move when you press the Touch Sensor or the IR Beacon button.

Kraz3 reacts in funny ways to different colors.
