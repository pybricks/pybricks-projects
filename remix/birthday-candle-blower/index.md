Control the Birthday Candle Blower by the Powered-Up Remote as follows:

- Driving: (refer to the `RemoteControlledDriveBase` code below)
  - 2 Top/Plus buttons together: drive forward
  - 2 Bottom/Minus buttons together: drive backward
  - Top-Left/Left-Plus and Bottom-Right/Right-Minus together: turn left on the spot
  - Top-Right/Right-Plus and Bottom-Left/Left-Minus together: turn right on the spot
  - Top-Left/Left-Plus: turn left forward
  - Top-Right/Right-Plus: turn right forward
  - Bottom-Left/Left-Minus: turn left backward
  - Bottom-Right/Right-Minus: turn right backward

- Singing Happy Birthday: green Center button

- Spinning the Fan: 
  - Clockwise (from robot's point of view): red Right button
  - Counterclockwise: left Red button


## Technical Design Notes

For the fan to spin fast enough to blow candles, we need a very large gear attached to the fan motor and a very small gear attached to the fan's axis.

The fan blades' facing and spinning directions also matter. In the pictured design, the fan only generates strong forward wind when:
- the bottoms of the blade pieces face forward; AND
- the fan spins clockwise from the robot's point of view.
